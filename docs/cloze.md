# Cloze

Cloze template.

Besides the dedicated cloze template, all other templates can enable the cloze function in settings (effective on the next card).

To use, wrap the text you want to cloze with double curly braces, for example, {{text}}. Multiple clozes and image/formula clozes are also supported.
